                      Recall that you are looking at the same kind of observations Vesto Slipher made from 1913 (Andromeda) 1914 - he had 15 galaxies - Hubble saw him present on these galaxies at a meeting in 1914 and saw astronomers give him a standing ovation (3 approaching. the rest were moving away. Kept adding to it over the years.). 1917 - he had 25 galaxies; by 1925 he had 45 galaxies - . We’ll ask you some questions about your data that astronomers in 1920 might have asked about Slipher’s data.
